My code is reliant on a linux or Mac based terminals which can be used by downloading a VPN and MobaXterm. Boise State's bascottie computers have all of which and can be used in the MEC building.

The software needed is Cisco Anyconnect which allows you to use the VPN and MobaXterm.

My code can be run by using the code: python plot.py.
To change what material is graphed you will need to go into the plot.py file.
Use the command: "vim plot.py" then on line 15 there is a line that starts with "filename=".
Edit the material name after the equals sign to change what is graphed.
For example: change aluminum_raw to tungsten2_raw
The list of what you can change is:
-tungsten_raw
-tunsten2_raw
-tunsten3_raw
-glass_raw
-ultem_raw
-steel_raw
-aluminum_raw
-aluminum2_raw
-aluminum3_raw

When the code "python plot.py" is run in the terminal, a graph will pop up that has the Stress vs Strain curve and a green dashed line that has the average slope of the entire curve.
The Young's Modulus is displayed after the graph is closed in the terminal window.

Trials and Tribulations:
The hardest part of this project was just trying to do specific tasks without knowing the actual commands needed to do so. What I mean by that is that I could not find out how to copy a file into another file and then modify the copy to be the specific specimen I needed.
I only had a couple aha moments. Most of which were when I was learning how to plot the data. Realizing which lines were unnecessary and which lines could be condensed were big #NailedIt moments for me.
The one thing I think I do not have is the linear fit over the correct area.
Nobody seems to have it from what I understand so I don't feel dumb.
I just wish I could have gotten all the points and criteria for this project.
